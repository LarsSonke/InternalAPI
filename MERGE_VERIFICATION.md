## 🔍 Key Differences Resolved

1. **Circuit Breaker Enhancement**: Added missing `CircuitOpen` field to ServiceMetrics
2. **Route Structure**: Maintained comprehensive routing from InternalAPI-master
3. **Handler Architecture**: Preserved constructor-based handler pattern
4. **Service Layer**: Kept external service integration with circuit breaker protection

## 🚀 Verification Results

- ✅ **Compilation**: Successful build with no errors
- ✅ **Runtime**: API starts and serves all endpoints correctly
- ✅ **Health Checks**: All health and monitoring endpoints operational
- ✅ **Circuit Breakers**: Enhanced metrics tracking working
- ✅ **Authentication**: JWT middleware and role-based access control functional
